%% 6. Which of the four heuristics are admissible?

%%  - hfn_null
<6.1>
yes

%%  - hfn_misplaced
<6.2>
yes

%%  - hfn_manhattan
<6.3>
yes

%%  - hfn_inversions
<6.4>
yes

% 7. Suppose for sliding a tile to the left we would change the
% cost from 1 to 0.5 and leave all the other moves the same cost.
% Does this affect the admissibility of the heuristics? Which of
% them are admissible now?


%%  - hfn_null
<7.1.1>
yes

<7.1.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]


%%  - hfn_misplaced
<7.2.1>
no

<7.2.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]
The heurisitc function is not admissible when there is at least one or more movement of a tile to the left. When there is a movement to the left
the actual cost of reaching the goal state decreases without regards to the number of misplaced tiles in state S. This cause the function to overestimate the cost to reach a goal state.


%%  - hfn_manhattan
<7.3.1>
no

<7.3.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]
The heurisitc function is not admissible when there is at least one or more movement of a tile to the left. When there is a movement to the left
the actual cost of reaching the goal state decreases without regards to the number of misplaced tiles in state S. This cause the function to overestimate the cost to reach a goal state.


%%  - hfn_inversions
<7.4.1>
no

<7.4.2>

% 8. Now suppose we would change the cost for sliding a tile to the
% left to 2 and leave all the other moves the same cost. Does this
% now affect the admissibility of the four heuristics? Again, which
% of them are admissible?

%%  - hfn_null
<8.1.1>
yes

<8.1.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]


%%  - hfn_misplaced
<8.2.1>

[if no explain in 100 words or less]


%%  - hfn_manhattan
<8.3.1>
yes

<8.3.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]

% 9. In the former modification (sliding to the LEFT costs 0.5), can
% you say for sure which heuristic will be the fastest (expand the
% least number of states) in finding a (not necessary optimal)
% solution? Explain.
<9.1>
yes

<9.2>
[explain in 100 words or less]
Out of the three I believe "hfn_misplaced" will be the fastest in finding a solution.This is because the heuristic function simply
returns the count of misplaced titles in states S where as the other function require calculating the manhattan distance and counting
the number of inverted pair of tiles which requires expanding more states hence requires more time. 

%% /* ------------------------------------------------------ */

% 10. One can obtain another heuristic for the N-puzzle by relaxing the
% problem as follows: let's say that a tile can move from square A to
% square B if B is blank.  The exact solution to this problem defines
% Gaschnig's heuristic. Explain why Gaschnig's heuristic is at
% least as accurate as hfn_misplaced.  Show some cases where it
% is more accurate than both the hfn_misplaced} and 
% hfn_manhattan} heuristics.  Can you suggest a way to calculate
% Gaschnig's heuristic efficiently?

<10.1>
[explain in 100 words or less]
The main difference between Gaschnig's heuristic and hft_misplaced heuristic is , hfn_misplaced can place any tile in any different position in one move while Gaschnig's can only move
the tile to a blank spot.If the blank location is in the goal position and tiles are still misplaced then Gaschnig's heuristic might need at least two moves hence gaschnig's heurisitc always returns
an equal or more number of moves than hfn_misplaced heurisitic.

<10.2>
[describe cases in 100 words or less]
Given board representation a state S = [[2,1],[3,blank]. Goal State is [[1,2],[3,blank]].
hfn_misplaced heuristic will return 2.
hfn_manhattan heuristic will return 2.
But Gaschnig's heuristic will return 3, being more accurate than the other two.

<10.3>
[explain in 100 words or less]
To calculate Gaschnig's heuristic's more efficiently :-
Given B is the current 'blank' location, 
if B is occupied by tile X (not 'blank') in the goal state, 
move X to B, 
otherwise, move any misplaced tile to B.
Repeat until the goal state is reached.
